I ðŸ’™ and respect <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software" target="_blank">FOSS</a>.

Some fun projects of services I have deployed in no particular order. 

ðŸ”˜ [Strfry](https://relay.cxcore.net/) - <a href="https://github.com/hoytech/strfry" target="_blank">strfry</a> is a relay for the nostr protocol that supports LMDB - a lightning fast database manager that is also used in OpenLDAP. This relay is using Docker and Nginx.

ðŸ”˜ [PrivateBin](https://bin.kode.im/) - a minimalist, open source online pastebin where the server has zero knowledge of pasted data. Data is encrypted/decrypted in the browser using 256 bits AES 

ðŸ”˜ [Arch Email](https://archlinux.email/) - an Arch Linux mail domain not affiliated with the official Arch Linux project, but for those that support and appreciate a simple, lightweight distribution

ðŸ”˜ [SKS](https://keys.kode.email) - an OpenPGP public key server that allows automatic public key lookup to make email privacy just as painless as modern messengers

ðŸ”˜ [Minecraft](https://minecraft.gg0x.games/) - a GG0x Minecraft Bedrock server

~~ðŸ”˜ [KIM](https://kode.im) - a federated end-to-end encrypted Matrix messaging homeserver~~

~~ðŸ”˜ [Searx](https://s.kode.im/) - a privacy-respecting metasearch engine~~

~~ðŸ”˜ [Tor Bridge](https://metrics.torproject.org/rs.html#details/0880F347244737A79838489A61CCF40FD3E49725) - an obfs4 bridge to <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/run-tor-bridges-defend-open-internet" target="_blank">help</a> censored users connect to the open internet through Tor when users are being oppressed in countries like China, Iran, and Kazakhstan that exercise information control by trying to block Tor~~
