# Intro
I stumbled across [openssh-ldap-publickey](https://github.com/AndriiGrytsenko/openssh-ldap-publickey) while looking to setup SSH keys in LDAP and found the setup to be a breeze. The project provides a wrapper for OpenSSH to store public keys inside the OpenLDAP entry. Here I will document the steps I went through to get SSH key auth working with OpenLDAP.

### LDAP SSH Steps
1. First install some dependencies. Here are the Arch Linux package names and designated repos.

**_Update 09/22/17_**: For those on Arch Linux, I created an [Arch PKGBUILD](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/openssh-ldap-publickey/) that can be used to install `openssh-ldap-publickey` and dependencies.

```
community/perl-net-ldap-server 0.43-3 [installed]
  Perl extension for LDAP server side protocol handling

aur/pear-net-ldap2 2.2.0-3 [installed] (1) (0.41)
  Object oriented interface for searching and manipulating LDAP-entries

aur/pear-net-ldap3 1.0.4-2 [installed] (1) (0.41)
  Object oriented interface for searching and manipulating LDAP-entries
```

2. Load `openssh-lpk-openldap.schema` into OpenLDAP.

*Inside `sshd_config` we have a couple of options*

3. Use `authorized_keys` **and** LDAP:  `AuthorizedKeysFile .ssh/authorized_keys`
4. Use **only** LDAP:  `AuthorizedKeysFile /dev/null`

5. Include these two lines
```
AuthorizedKeysCommand /usr/local/bin/openssh-ldap-publickey
AuthorizedKeysCommandUser nobody
```

### LDAP SSH Users
A typical LDAP `People` record can now have a new objectClass `ldapPublicKey` and attribute `sshPublicKey` in which case a user's public key can be attached to the `sshPublicKey` attribute.
