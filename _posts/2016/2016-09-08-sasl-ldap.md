# Intro
Although Dovecot provides it's own SASL, I opted for Cyrus SASL. It is fairly simple to configure both, but in this post I will demonstrate what worked for me.

#### /etc/saslauthd.conf
```
ldap_servers: ldap://ldap.example.net
ldap_version: 3
ldap_search_base: ou=Mail,dc=example,dc=net
ldap_scope: sub
ldap_filter: (&(uid=%u)(mailEnabled=TRUE))
ldap_auth_method: bind
ldap_timeout: 10
ldap_time_limit: 10
```
For LDAP authentication the above options worked in my environment. To use the `mailEnabled` attribute make sure [postfix-book.schema](https://github.com/variablenix/ldap-mail-schema/blob/master/postfix-book.schema) is loaded into your LDAP implementation like OpenLDAP. With this we're basically saying users who have Enabled accounts are allowed to authenticate.

#### /etc/conf.d/saslauthd
`SASLAUTHD_OPTS="-a ldap"`

#### /usr/lib/sasl2/smtpd.conf
```
pwcheck_method: saslauthd
mech_list: plain
log_level: 7

```
Once everything is in place a simple `systemctl restart saslauthd` is all that is needed. You should now be able to add your LDAP account credentials to any mail application's SMTP settings.
